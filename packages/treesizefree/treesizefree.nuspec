    <description>Every hard disk is too small if you just wait long enough. TreeSize Free tells you where precious disk space has gone.

TreeSize Free can be started from the context menu of a folder or drive and shows you the size of this folder, including its subfolders. Expand folders in an Explorer-like fashion and see the size of every subfolder. All results can also be drilled down to the file level. Scanning operations run in a thread, so you can already see results while TreeSize Free is working. The Explorer context menu is supported within TreeSize, as well as the usual drag &amp; drop operations.

Installation instructions:
TreeSize Free is automatically installed in English to "Program Files\JAM Software\TreeSize Free" (32 Bit) or to "Program Files (x86)\JAM Software\TreeSize Free" (64 Bit).
There are two parameter you can give to the installer if you add "-params" to the installation command:

1. "/dir=Your_Dir"
Changes the installation location to "Your_Dir".

2. "/lang=DE"
Changes the language from English to German. There are no other supported languages.

Example:
cinst treesizefree -params "/dir=C:\Users\Administrator\Admin Tools\ /lang=de"</description>
