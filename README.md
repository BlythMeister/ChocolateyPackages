# ChocolateyPackages

This repository contains the packages I maintain and publish to [Chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org).

## "I want a new version of <X>!"

That's perfectly fine! Pull requests are welcome. Update the package you wish to have a new version for and I'll get it up to [Chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org).
